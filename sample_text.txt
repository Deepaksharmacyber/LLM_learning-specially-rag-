Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. It includes subfields such as machine learning and deep learning.

Machine learning enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It is widely used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.

Natural language processing (NLP) allows computers to understand and communicate in human language. Chatbots and voice assistants are practical applications of NLP.
